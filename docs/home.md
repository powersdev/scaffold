# Overview

Theme based on Laravel, Timber, and Sage

Initially created to be the default site repo for the [Local](//local.powers.dev) project.

## Structure

At a high level, there is one `plugin` and one `theme`.

### Plugins

- #### [Debug](/plugins/debug.md)

	I'm a fan of the [Tracy](//tracy.nette.org) debugger from the [Nette Foundation](//nette.org), and fortunately there happens to be [a composer package](//github.com/hlavacm/wp-tracy) to integrate it with WordPress.

	This is set up as a `mu-plugin` to include and configure the above.

### Themes

- #### [Scaffold](/themes/scaffold.md)

	This is the primary "project" in this repo.

	It is a theme that integrates some of my favorite tools and concepts from other projects.

	It is not intended as a production-ready theme, but rather as a sandbox in which I can explore new ideas.

	It also serves as the default site repo for the somewhat-related [Local](//local.powers.dev) project.
